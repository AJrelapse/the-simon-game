# THE SIMON GAME

## What's The Game
In Simon Game, players start by pressing a button to begin the game. The device displays a sequence of colored lights and sounds. Players must then replicate the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons in the same order. If successful, the sequence becomes longer and more complex. However, a single mistake ends the game. With each successful round, the game increases in difficulty, challenging players' memory and concentration skills as they strive to beat their own or others' high scores.
